# Sleep Data Analysis with Python

### Project:
I set out to analyze the sleep data I recorded using the Sleep Cycle app. Sleep Cycle tracks several statistics while you sleep, including time asleep, movements per hour, regularity, snoring, and more. It also calculates a sleep quality score based on the statistics it records. My objective was to investigate the correlation between sleep quality and several variables to determine how strongly different factors influence my sleep quality score.

To achieve this, I first created data visualizations to illustrate the correlations between various factors and sleep quality. Then, I developed models to predict my sleep quality score based on the input variables. This approach allowed me to identify key factors that affect my sleep quality and provided insights into how I might improve my sleep habits.
